# KaliaBot
Twitter bot for getting the prices for cheap lager beers in Prisma (hypermarket franchise in Finland). The prices of beer fluctuate A LOT in these stores, so this delivers them daily for our pleasure! This bot was born almost immediatelly after the birth of GambinaBot, and this is my fourth bot. üçª

Currently not working as Foodie has apparently changed their source code.

# Features
  - Gets five beer brands from Foodie (the price site for S-Ryhm√§'s stores)
  - Forms a tweet with the price of 24 and 1 can(s) of all the beers
  - Posting between 9AM to 3PM randomly daily
  
 # What did I do/learn?
  - How bots overall work (my fourth one!)
  - Further web scraping with BeautifulSoup
  - Random cron jobs
